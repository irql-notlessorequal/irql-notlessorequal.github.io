title: Acer One S1003 and Linux

I wanted to publish some fairly old notes about this device and warn those that want to put Linux on them as it will bite.

## Getting Linux working

<br />

### Important Preface

<br />

This device has an internal BIOS option called "OS selection", this controls some unknown BIOS behavior but
primarily ACPI tables and defaults to "Windows 8.1" (`windows_8.x`), however some bootloaders like GRUB may cause it to change to other values including "Android".

If this happens the following may occur:

- All versions of Windows are no longer bootable at all due to invalid ACPI tables
- WiFi stops working as the chip is no longer detected, at least on my one which uses a Broadcom chip

If you encounter these issues see the "I hate this BIOS" section for help.

> **UPDATE**: Use `systemd-boot` on Linux, it seems to work just fine.

<br />

### Bootloader Hell

<br />

Reminder that this device uses IA-32 (32-bit) UEFI, meaning that some Linux distros may not boot as
they lack the correct files needed in order to boot or may install and not be bootable since their installer will
incorrectly assume that you are using a 64-bit UEFI environment. [1] [2]

[1] Typically replacing `--target=x86_64-efi` with `--target=i386-efi` should do the trick with GRUB installs.

<br />

### Mitigating hangs and freezes

<br />

> ⚠️ This section is out-of-date, the only known cause of hangs is a nearly discharged battery.

Apparently Baytrail/Cherryview laptops have a tendency to hang, I have yet to encounter this issue aside from once, which is when the battery reached 0%.
For those dying on the inside with this issue, the following kernel parameters may help.

- `intel_idle.max_cstate=5` (Allow C1 <-> C5, disable C6)
- `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` (Allow C1 only, disable all other states, this one hurts battery life the most)

<br />

### Mitigating having zero RAM

<br />

Uh...

I mean [zRAM](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html) is the best option, set it to around fifty percent.

Using a swap partition will just wear out the now aging eMMC.

<br />

### Audio

<br />

The hardware setup uses SOF (Sound Open-Firmware), install the firmware (on Arch Linux the package is `sof-firmware`) and reboot.

You should have functioning audio.

<br />

### Backlight, Buttons and Volume Control

<br />

Buttons seem to work with the `acpi_osi=Linux` or `acpi_osi='Windows 2015'` kernel parameter.

The backlight can be fixed by appending the following modules to your `initcpio` config within your distro:

```
pwm_lpss pwm_lpss_platform pwm_lpss_pci
```

(If you have the kernel driver for the GPU preloaded, you should put these before `i915`)

You may also encounter some PMIC errors or SoC related errors, to fix those append the following also:

```
axp20x axp20x_i2c axp288_adc
```

<br />

### Wireless

<br />

You may encounter a missing NVRAM error from the `brcmfmac` driver, to fix this do the following.

1. Download the "Wireless LAN" driver from the Acer website, you'll need a file like `Wireless LAN_Broadcom_1.596.10.0_W10x86_A.zip`

2. Extract the contents into a folder of your choice.

3. I have a `BCM43430/a0` chip, meaning that I must copy the `43438a0rtecdc.bin` file into `/lib/firmware/brcm/`
under the following file name: `brcmfmac43430a0-sdio.Acer-One S1003.bin` (as indicated by the error in `dmesg`)

4. You'll also need to place a `brcmfmac43430a0-sdio.txt` file in the same folder, there is no config here, I'll use the one from the Internet.

```

5. Reboot your machine and cross your fingers.

<br />

### Bluetooth

<br />

The HCD files are not available in Linux by default, on Arch Linux this can be solved by installing the `brcm43xx-firmware`
package which is available on the AUR.

Otherwise, you can obtain the HCD files from the Acer driver website by downloading the bluetooth driver, the file you need is `Bluetooth_Broadcom_12.0.1.840_W10x86_A.zip`.

<br />

### Suspend

<br />

Seems to work just fine because it's an `s2idle` platform.

## I hate this BIOS.

<br />

This tablet uses an InsydeH2O BIOS environment, cool.

It exposes a massive amount of options and by that I mean like eight of them, all of them useless.

However, there is a way to access the internal options and change them around, you'll need to find a copy of the leaked InsydeH2O tools
that are probably still findable on the Internet assuming they haven't been DMCA'd out of existence.

The file you are looking for is `h2ouve-100.00.16.12-1.bin.src.rpm`, this is the UEFI Variable Editor that provides the means of changing settings through the CLI or a Web Browser, (not joking) extract it using `rpm2cpio -i ...bin.src.rpm | cpio -idmv` and you should get two `.tar.bz2` files of which one is a 32-bit version and the other is a 64-bit version, you'll want the 64-bit version since you are using a 64-bit Linux kernel unless you are truly insane.

Extract the 64-bit version of the `.tar.bz2` into a folder of your choice and you should have a bunch of files, so we can go edit the BIOS now?

No.

First we need to patch, compile and load a kernel module that lets the software access the BIOS.

Go into the `driver` folder.

Open the `phy_alloc.c` file and prepare to make the following changes:

If you're running Linux 5.12 or newer, remove the following line at the bottom:

```
MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEVICE( "Insyde" );
```

If you're running Linux 6.4 or newer, change the following line:

```
-	pDrvDevClass = class_create (THIS_MODULE, DEVICE_NAME);
+	pDrvDevClass = class_create (DEVICE_NAME);
```

Run `make` to compile the package with the `Makefile` provided and you should have `phy_alloc.ko`
in the directory.

You can run `sudo insmod phy_alloc.ko` to load the kernel module, you are now all set and can
go back to the main directory.

Now we can run `sudo ./h2ouve-lx64` and edit variables, you can also launch the GUI if you have
GTK2 available in your OS but be warned that many browsers won't launch under a `root` account
if you wish to launch the Web Browser version of the BIOS editor.

To undo the broken ACPI tables run the following command:

```
sudo ./h2ouve-lx64 -d40 -m os_selection windows_8.x
```

Then reboot, remember the above section about the bootloader.

Finally, for those that wish to dig more with their BIOS remember this too:

**THERE IS A HIDDEN OPTION CALLED "H2OUVE", WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT DISABLE THIS OPTION.**
